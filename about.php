<h2>About</h2>
<p>
<b>Before this, no dictionary was like this ðŸ™Œ</b><br>
Wordo is an English dictionary that is different in two ways. Firstly, Wordo is beautifully designed, and has a minimal and user-friendly interface. Secondly, Wordo is social and allows you to follow your friends, and 'like' words which will appear in your friends Notifications. You can discover new words by seeing your friends activity.
<br><br>

<b>Fuck ads</b><br>

Wordo runs without advertisements, and is freed from all the nonsense that most people donâ€™t use when looking up definitions ðŸ’–.
